# Refactoring block commit

Minimizing the size block commit by using validator number instead of validator address.

## Specification

This proposal offers to change commit from this:

```go
const (
	CommitNotSigned = 0
	CommitSigned    = 1
)

type Committer struct {
	Address Address // Address is 20 bytes
	Status  int
}


type Commit struct {
	Round      int
	Signature  Signature
	Committers []Committer
}
```
To this:

```go
type Commit struct {
	BlockHash Hash
	Round     int
	Signed    []int
	Missed    []int
	Signature Signature
}
```

There are two major changes here:
* Adding block hash to commit
* Using validator number instead of validator address

By including block hash we can verify commit individually without having block header and using validators number helps us to significantly reduce the size of the block commit.




Currently the testnet has reached 100,00 blocks and the size of blockchain is about 100 Megabyte. By applying this change we might reduce the size of blockchain about 30 to 40 percent. Testnet is running by only 4 validators.
